        <p class="text">I am a first-year MCA student at Christ University, Bangalore, with a passion for Computer Science that stems from an unexpected source. During my fourth semester of my bachelor's in Chemistry, I stumbled upon DeepMind's AI chess engine AlphaZero, and I was instantly captivated by the way it could learn to play chess from scratch. Intrigued, I began to research the underlying concepts and realized that programming was the key to unlocking the potential of machine learning. Motivated by this newfound interest, I started to learn Python as a personal side project, and soon after, I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in Computer Science.

            Coming from a non-CS background, I bring a unique perspective to the field and am excited to continue developing my skills and knowledge in this fast-paced and ever-changing industry. I am a hardworking, motivated, and detail-oriented individual who is always eager to learn and grow. Outside of my studies, I enjoy reading and exploring new technologies. Let's connect and explore the possibilities!</p>
